# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

## Option 1: Automatic Setup (Recommended)

If you have GitHub CLI installed:

```bash
cd /Users/mikek/syntest-lib
./setup_github.sh
```

This script will:
- Create the GitHub repository automatically
- Set up the remote origin
- Push all code to GitHub

## Option 2: Manual Setup

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `syntest-lib`
3. Description: `A comprehensive Python library for managing Kentik synthetic tests, labels, and sites with CSV-based bulk management`
4. Make it **Public**
5. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
6. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Push Code to GitHub

Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
cd /Users/mikek/syntest-lib

# Add GitHub as remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/mkrygeri/syntest-lib.git

# Push code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## Installation of GitHub CLI (Optional)

If you want to use the automatic setup:

### macOS
```bash
brew install gh
gh auth login
```

### Linux
```bash
curl -fsSL https://cli.github.com/packages/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg | sudo dd of=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg] https://cli.github.com/packages stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/github-cli.list > /dev/null
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gh
gh auth login
```

## After Setup

Once your repository is created and pushed:

1. Visit: https://github.com/mkrygeri/syntest-lib
2. The README.md will be displayed with full documentation
3. All examples and CSV files will be available
4. Tests can be run from GitHub Actions (if you set up CI/CD)

## Repository Statistics

Your repository includes:
- **6,061 lines** of code across 25 files
- **Python library** with full package structure
- **Comprehensive test suite** (19 tests with 66% coverage)
- **CSV management system** for bulk operations
- **Complete documentation** and examples
- **Enterprise-ready features** for large-scale deployments

## Next Steps

1. Set up GitHub repository (using one of the options above)
2. Consider setting up GitHub Actions for CI/CD
3. Add any additional documentation or examples
4. When ready, publish to PyPI for public distribution
